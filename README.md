UNet-RCAN is a two-step prediction algorithm for supervised denosing of fast stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) data, built in Tensorflow 2.7.0 framework.

# Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Notebooks
Notebooks are in the ```notebooks``` folder along with a description of adjustable parameters.

# Training
```
git clone https://github.com/vebrahimi1990/UNet_RCAN_Denoising.git
```

For training, add the directory to your training dataset and a directory to save the model to the configuration file ```(config_(2D/3D).py)```.

```
python train_2D.py
``` 
```
python train_3D.py
```

# Evaluation
For evaluation, add the directory to your test dataset and a directory to the saved model to the configuration file ```(config_(2D/3D).py)```.

```
python evaluate_2D.py
```
```
python evaluate_3D.py
```
